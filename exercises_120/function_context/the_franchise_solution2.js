// The Franchise - Solution 2
// In the previous exercise, we had a situation where an anonymous method passed to map had an undesirable execution context. We solved the problem by taking advantage of lexical scoping and introducing a new variable self. Solve the same problem again by passing a hard-bound anonymous function to map.

let franchise = {
  name: 'How to Train Your Dragon',
  allMovies: function() {
    return [1, 2, 3].map(function(number) {
      return this.name + ' ' + number;
    }.bind(this));
  },

};

console.log(franchise.allMovies());

/*
We can use the bind method to hard-bind a function, meaning that it returns a new function that is permanently bound to the object provided to bind.
